      <h1>Don’t cut calories, just focus on whole foods</h1>
      <p>Total energy intake is one of the most important nutritional considerations for men who are trying to gain muscle mass,” Witard says. “Muscle protein synthesis is an energetically expensive process. Therefore, to maximize muscle mass, a positive energy balance is necessary.</p>

      <h1>Eat about 20-25 grams of protein</h1>
      <p> You know you need protein to build muscle, but even more important than how much protein you eat per day is how much you eat per meal,it’s best to consume 0.25 to 0.30 grams per kg of body mass (or 0.11 to 0.14 grams per pound of body weight) at each meal. So, if you weigh 180 pounds, that works out to 20 to 25 grams of protein at breakfast, lunch.</p>

      <h1> Focus on compound lifts</h1>
      <p>Compound movements and big or heavy lifts are best for putting on size,” Gilles says. That’s because they allow you to both work more muscles at once as well as lift more weight with every rep, causing more stress, damage, and, ultimately, remodeling in your muscle fibers. Various studies demonstrate that large muscle group exercises are ideal for spiking the body’s levels of testosterone and other muscle-building hormones.</p>

      <h1>Get better sleep</h1>
      <p>Train your muscles all you want, but they won’t get any bigger until you actually give them a chance to build back up post-workout. “The easiest way to recover is to get eight to 10 hours of sleep each night. It’s hard to get, but that complex interaction that I discussed previously involving protein synthesis takes place when you sleep.</p>
